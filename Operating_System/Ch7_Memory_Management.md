* **Binding**
    * Stactic ( logical address = physical address )
      * Compiling Time (Compiler) → absolute code
      * Loading Time (linking loader) → relocatable code
        * Relocation修正 & linking修正
    * Dynamic ( logical address ≠ physical address ) 
      * Execution Time (O.S)
        * 優點 & 缺點
* Logical address : CPU → Logical address (user site) → Logical address space      
  Physical address : Memory → Physical address (Hareware site e.g RAM) → Physical address space
* **Dynamic loading**
